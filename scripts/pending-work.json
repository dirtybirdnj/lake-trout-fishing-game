    "description": "Add realistic fish movement patterns using boids-style flocking algorithm. Fish should exhibit cohesion, separation, and alignment behaviors when moving in schools.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- Fish maintain proper spacing within schools\n- Schools react to player movement and lure\n- Performance optimized for multiple schools\n- Configurable behavior parameters",

    "description": "When depth exceeds 100 feet, the sonar display shows visual artifacts and flickering. This appears to be a rendering pipeline issue with the Phaser graphics system.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Start game and navigate to deep water area\n2. Lower lure below 100 feet\n3. Observe sonar display\n\n**Expected:** Clean sonar rendering at all depths\n**Actual:** Flickering and artifacts appear",
