# Test Coverage Analysis: Duplicate `depthScale` Declaration Bug

## The Bug
**Location:** `src/entities/Lure.js:116` and `src/entities/Lure.js:135`

**Error:**
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'depthScale' has already been declared
```

**Root Cause:** The `depthScale` variable was declared twice in the same scope within the `update()` method:
- Line 116: `const depthScale = this.scene.sonarDisplay ? this.scene.sonarDisplay.getDepthScale() : GameConfig.DEPTH_SCALE;`
- Line 135: `const depthScale = ...` (duplicate declaration)

## What Test Coverage Would Have Caught This

### 1. ✅ **Basic Unit Tests** (MOST IMPORTANT)
**Test Type:** Unit test for the `Lure` class

**What it would catch:**
- Any test that calls `lure.update()` would immediately fail with the SyntaxError
- This is a **compile-time error** that prevents the module from even loading

**Example test that catches it:**
```javascript
test('should call update() without syntax errors', () => {
    const scene = new MockScene();
    const lure = new Lure(scene, 100, 50);

    expect(() => {
        lure.update();  // ❌ Would throw SyntaxError with duplicate declaration
    }).not.toThrow();
});
```

**Coverage gap before fix:**
- ❌ No `Lure.test.js` file existed
- ❌ No tests exercised the `update()` method

**Now fixed:**
- ✅ Created `__tests__/entities/Lure.test.js` with 15+ tests
- ✅ Tests specifically verify `update()` can be called without errors
- ✅ Tests verify dynamic depth scaling works correctly

---

### 2. ✅ **Static Analysis / Linting**
**Tool:** ESLint with `no-redeclare` rule

**What it would catch:**
```javascript
// ESLint would flag this immediately:
const depthScale = 3.6;  // Line 116
const depthScale = 5.0;  // ❌ Error: 'depthScale' is already defined
```

**How to enable:**
```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-redeclare": "error"
  }
}
```

**Coverage gap before fix:**
- ❌ ESLint not configured or not running on pre-commit
- ❌ CI/CD not running linter

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Add ESLint to pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Add linting step to CI/CD pipeline

---

### 3. ✅ **Integration Tests**
**Test Type:** Full game loop integration test

**What it would catch:**
```javascript
test('game scene should run update loop without errors', () => {
    const scene = new GameScene();
    scene.create();

    expect(() => {
        scene.update(0, 16);  // ❌ Would fail when lure.update() is called
    }).not.toThrow();
});
```

**Coverage gap before fix:**
- ❌ No integration tests for full game loop
- ❌ Tests don't verify scene update cycles

---

### 4. ✅ **Smoke Tests / Module Loading**
**Test Type:** Simple import/require test

**What it would catch:**
```javascript
test('Lure module should load without syntax errors', () => {
    expect(() => {
        const { Lure } = require('../../src/entities/Lure.js');
    }).not.toThrow();
});
```

**Coverage gap before fix:**
- ❌ No smoke tests for individual modules
- ⚠️ The SyntaxError would appear when the module is executed, not just imported

---

### 5. ✅ **Manual Testing / QA**
**Test Type:** Load the game in a browser

**What it would catch:**
- Browser console would show the SyntaxError immediately
- Game would not load at all

**Coverage gap before fix:**
- ❌ Changes pushed without manual testing
- ❌ No QA checklist for "does the game load?"

---

## Test Coverage Priority (Most to Least Important)

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Would have caught immediately:
1. **Basic unit test calling `lure.update()`** ← Created this
2. **ESLint with `no-redeclare` rule** ← Should add
3. **Module smoke test** ← Should add

### 🟡 MEDIUM - Would catch during integration:
4. **Integration test for game loop**
5. **CI/CD pipeline running tests**

### 🟢 LOW - Would catch during QA:
6. **Manual testing / browser load**
7. **E2E tests**

## Recommendations to Prevent Similar Bugs

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Add `Lure.test.js`** - DONE
2. 🔲 **Configure ESLint** with `no-redeclare` rule
3. 🔲 **Add pre-commit hooks** to run linter and tests
4. 🔲 **Create smoke tests** for all entities

### Medium Term:
5. 🔲 **Add CI/CD checks** that fail on lint errors
6. 🔲 **Increase test coverage** to 80%+ for core entities
7. 🔲 **Add integration tests** for game loop

### Example Pre-commit Hook:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "Running linter..."
npm run lint || exit 1

echo "Running tests..."
npm test || exit 1

echo "✅ Pre-commit checks passed"
```

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code changes, check for:

- [ ] No duplicate variable declarations in same scope
- [ ] Variables used before declaration
- [ ] Tests exist for modified code
- [ ] Tests actually call the modified methods
- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] Manual smoke test performed

---

## Conclusion

**This bug was trivially preventable** with basic unit testing. The most effective solution is:

1. **Write tests first** (TDD) - Test would have failed before code was written
2. **Run tests before committing** - Pre-commit hook would catch it
3. **Use static analysis** - ESLint would flag it in the editor

The new `Lure.test.js` file ensures this specific bug (and similar ones) cannot happen again.
