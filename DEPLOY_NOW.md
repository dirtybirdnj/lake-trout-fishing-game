## Quick Deploy (Choose One)

### Option 1: GitHub Pages Deployment

```bash
# You're already on the deployment branch!
# Just build and deploy:

npm run build
git add dist/ -f  # Force add the dist folder
git commit -m "Build for demo deployment"
git push origin deploy-for-demo-2025-10-25 -f

# Then go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Pages
# Set source to: deploy-for-demo-2025-10-25 branch
```

### Option 2: Local Testing First

```bash
# Test it locally before deploying:
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:8080
# Test the game for 2 minutes:
# 1. Start kayak mode
# 2. Navigate around
# 3. Press X to fish
# 4. Verify fish spawn
# 5. Verify terrain looks good

# If good, deploy:
npm run build
# Deploy using your method
```

### Option 3: Use Existing Deployment Script

If you have a deployment script:
```bash
# You're on the right commit!
./deploy.sh  # or whatever your script is
```

## What Changed From Latest Code

I rolled back from these commits (which had issues):
- ‚ùå `b7e724f` - Latest fixes (problems remained)
- ‚ùå `240c7d9` - Fish depth calculation (complex, possibly problematic)

To this stable commit:
- ‚úÖ `8ddaac1` - Fix fish spawning and add solid lake bottom

---

## After Your Demo

Once your demo is complete, we can resume debugging. I've created two documents:

1. **FIX_MAP_TERRAIN.md** - Details of what we were trying to fix
2. **STABLE_COMMITS_FOR_DEMO.md** - List of good commits to use

You can continue debugging by:
```bash
# Switch back to the latest code
git checkout claude/expand-game-map-fixes-011CUTSYCdp7WykMo7f9UBeH

# Or start fresh from the stable commit
git checkout deploy-for-demo-2025-10-25
git checkout -b new-debug-branch
```

## Troubleshooting

### If push fails with 403 error:
The branch might have session ID restrictions. Instead:
```bash
# Create a different branch name:
git checkout -b demo-oct-25
git push origin demo-oct-25
```

### If npm run build fails:
```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed:
npm install
npm run build
```

### If the game still has issues at commit 8ddaac1:
Try the fallback commit:
```bash
git checkout 597da34
# This is one commit earlier, also stable
```
